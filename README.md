## How It Works
- **Data Storage**: Expenses and monthly history are stored in **localStorage** as JSON.
- **Daily Limits**: JavaScript calculates daily totals and applies the over-limit class for days > **â‚¹60**.
- **Monthly Reset**: Checks the date on load; if itâ€™s the last day, saves the total and resets expenses.
- **Responsiveness**: CSS uses `clamp()`, **flexbox**, and **media queries** to adapt to screen sizes.
- **Animations**: **GSAP** handles entrance animations for a polished feel.
